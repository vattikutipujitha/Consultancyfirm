# Consultancyfirm

We are working in a consultancy firm and have been asked
to develop a GUI based program which takes in details of the candidate (Name,
Age, Educational Qualifications, Work Experience, Skills, Languages known
and hobbies) and displays various jobs that are suitable to them basing on the
requirements. It should also send their CV’s to the companies they’ve applied
for and should display a message if they’ve been called for an interview by any
of the companies.
